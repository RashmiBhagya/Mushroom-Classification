# Mushroom-Classification
Machine learning project for ML module
In this investigation,
we aim to apply a wide range of machine learning methods including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector classification
to detect patterns and relationships within the dataset. By comparing the accuracies of different models, we hope to establish the best accurate technique
for predicting the edibility of mushrooms based on their properties. Through this investigation, we hope to contribute to the continuing conversation 
regarding mushroom safety and support educated decision-making for aficionados and foragers alike.
